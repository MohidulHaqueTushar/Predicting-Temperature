# Predicting-Temperature
## Perform a machine learning experiment  to find the best model that predicts the temperature in London!

**Project Description:** <be>
As the climate changes around the world, the ability to predict changing weather is becoming more and more important.

Predicting the mean temperature in London is the main focus: <be>
- Import, preprocess, and explore historical weather data and automate the training and evaluation of multiple machine-learning models.<be>
- Setup an automated workflow using functions, utilizing methods from `sklearn` and `MLflow`.

**Project Tasks** <be>
- Use MLflow to log training runs for a model that predicts mean temperature in London!
